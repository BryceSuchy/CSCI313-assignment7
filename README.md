# NDSU-CSCI313-Assignment7Template
Template based on the shoot em up game from Travis Faas book An Introduction to HTML5 Game Development with Phaser.JS


We did these bonus things

(1) Change the spawn rate of the enemies
 (1) Change the multiplier for the spawn rate
 (1) Edit the enemy movement speed
 (1) Edit the player's movement speed or player drag
 (1) Change the chance the enemy is a shooter
 (3) Change the speed of the bullets
o Note: This is not built into the model yet
o For practice, 1) add a test that checks if the gun has a bullet speed property set to 200
by default; 2) Implement that in the model, 3) update the view to use the model
 (3) The amount of time between each bullet is hardcoded!
o Add tests and implementation to remove the hard-coded value
o You will also need to change some of the old tests.
 (1) Add background graphics for the Title screen
 (1) Add background graphic for the GameOver screens
 (1) Crop the images so the collisions are less "buggy
